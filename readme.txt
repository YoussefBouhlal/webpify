== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What image formats does WebPify support? =
WebPify currently supports **WebP** and **AVIF** — two of the most efficient modern image formats for the web.

= What happens to my original images after conversion? =
When you upload a new image (e.g., PNG or JPEG), WebPify automatically creates an optimized **WebP** version without keeping the original.  
For existing images that you optimize using the **Bulk Optimization** tool, Webpify will generate the new WebP version but will not delete your original images — they remain safe and untouched.

= Does this work with caching plugins? =
Yes! WebPify is fully compatible with popular caching and CDN plugins like **WP Rocket**, **W3 Total Cache**, and **Cloudflare**.

= Can I bulk convert my existing images? =
Yes. Use the **Bulk Conversion** tool in the WebPify settings page to convert all your media library images in one go.
